# SpPlayground

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

This is a sandbox to test out features and enhancements for production use.

## Issues

SPFX is unable to work with Angular Routing, so to get routing to work a 3rd party library @uirouter/angular, @uirouter/core is used.

## Start

use 'npm run start' to run only the angular version for UI changes which don't rely on any API calls.

## Build and Bundle

use 'npm run bundle' to create a single bundle file for use in the SPFX WebPart component.
